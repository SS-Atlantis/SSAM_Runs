parameters:
  # The run, forcing, physics, biology, and harvest parameters files are required for all runs,

forcing:
  # The keys must match the forcing file names in the forcing.prm file.
  # The file names in the forcing.prm file must be just file names, not path/filename.
  # The keys will be the names used for the symlinks created in the temporary run
